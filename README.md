COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project


This project is an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data, covering data cleaning, querying, and visualization. The analysis explores global COVID-19 trends and highlights key insights using Excel, MySQL, and Power BI.

Tools and Technologies

● Excel: Data cleaning and preprocessing

● MySQL: Data querying and filtering

● Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

Project Workflow

 Data Cleaning (Excel)
1. Loaded raw COVID-19 data into Excel.
   
2. Handled missing values, corrected data inconsistencies, and removed duplicate records.
 
3. Used Excel functions to format and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring data quality and integrity.

Data Querying (MySQL)

1.Imported the cleaned data into a MySQL database.

2.Wrote complex SQL queries to aggregate data, perform calculations (e.g., total cases, death rates), and filter data based on specific countries, regions, and timeframes.

3.Optimized query performance to handle large datasets.

 Below is a list insights generated from the queries :

● Mortality Rate: This query calculates the percentage of deaths in relation to the total number of cases. It helps us understand how severe the virus is in different locations and continents.

● Percentage of Population Infected with Covid: This query determines the percentage of the population that has contracted COVID-19. By comparing the total number of cases to the population size, we can evaluate the spread of the virus in various regions.

● Country with the Highest Infection Rate: This query identifies the country with the highest infection rate in proportion to its population. It calculates the percentage of the population that has been infected and highlights the location with the highest value.

● Highest Death Rate: This query identifies the country with the highest death rate per population. It calculates the percentage of the population that has died due to COVID-19 and highlights the location with the highest mortality rate.

● Country with the Highest Death rate compared to population: This query determines the country that has experienced the highest total number of deaths in comparison to the population. It provides insights into the countries most impacted by the virus.

● Continent with the Highest Death Count: This query identifies the continent with the highest total number of deaths. It helps us understand the overall impact of the pandemic on a larger scale.

● Global Cases per Day: This query presents the daily global COVID-19 cases, including the total number of new cases and new deaths. It also calculates the death rate as a percentage of new cases.


Data Visualization (Power BI)

1.Created interactive visualizations and dashboards in Power BI.

2.Visualized COVID-19 trends, including case growth, recovery rates, death rates, and regional comparisons.

3.Designed a user-friendly dashboard to present insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

Key Insights

● Showcased trends in global COVID-19 cases and recoveries over time.
● Highlighted significant differences in infection rates across regions.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete process of cleaning, querying, and visualizing COVID-19 data. The insights gained from this analysis can help policymakers, health professionals, and the public understand the spread and control of the virus.
