COVID-19 EDA PROJECT WITH SQL 


COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL
This is an end to end project focusing on analyzing data related to the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries. We will be working with a dataset that provides information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations varying across different locations and continents. The major goal is to gain valuable insights and answer important questions about the covid 19 pandemic.

We will be using SQL queries to address different aspects of the COVID-19 data. Below is a list insights generated from the queries :

Mortality Rate: This query calculates the percentage of deaths in relation to the total number of cases. It helps us understand how severe the virus is in different locations and continents.

Percentage of Population Infected with Covid: This query determines the percentage of the population that has contracted COVID-19. By comparing the total number of cases to the population size, we can evaluate the spread of the virus in various regions.

Country with the Highest Infection Rate: This query identifies the country with the highest infection rate in proportion to its population. It calculates the percentage of the population that has been infected and highlights the location with the highest value.

Highest Death Rate: This query identifies the country with the highest death rate per population. It calculates the percentage of the population that has died due to COVID-19 and highlights the location with the highest mortality rate.

Country with the Highest Death rate compared to population: This query determines the country that has experienced the highest total number of deaths in comparison to the population. It provides insights into the countries most impacted by the virus.

Continent with the Highest Death Count: This query identifies the continent with the highest total number of deaths. It helps us understand the overall impact of the pandemic on a larger scale.

Global Cases per Day: This query presents the daily global COVID-19 cases, including the total number of new cases and new deaths. It also calculates the death rate as a percentage of new cases.
